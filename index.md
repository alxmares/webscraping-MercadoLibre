## üìã Application Features

### 1. **Extract and Display Data**

- The application scrapes specified web pages for data including the title, price, brand, and images. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and extract relevant information.

### 2. **Save Data to CSV or Excel**

- Users can save the scraped data into CSV or Excel files directly from the application. The application allows for concatenating new data to existing files, making it easy to keep an ongoing record of scrapped information.

### 3. **Download Images**

- Scraped images can be downloaded to a specified directory. Users can select the directory where images will be saved, and all images from the scrape session will be downloaded.

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface

The application features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built with CustomTkinter. Users input the URL of the page they wish to scrape and can manage the scraping process through clearly labeled buttons and options.

## üîß How It Works

1. **Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup**: The application sends HTTP requests to the specified URL and parses the HTML content to extract the desired data.

2. **Data Manipulation with Pandas**: Extracted data is organized into dataframes using Pandas, allowing for easy data manipulation and export.

3. **GUI with CustomTkinter**: CustomTkinter provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application, making it accessible even for those without technical expertise.
